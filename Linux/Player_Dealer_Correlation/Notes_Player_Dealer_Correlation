The analysis performed on the logs given by the manager let determined that there was one particular player when ALL the 
largest losses happened during the dates provided by the manager (March 10, 12 and 15). A loss can be determined by the 
negative sign (-$). From this analysis was identified the specific hours where the possible suspect attended the casino with
the goal to identify who was the dealer helping to commit the fraud. 

The previous information was cross-referenced with the provided logs of the dealers shifts and game. With the days and times,
it was possible to determine what dealers where attending the roulette tables. As a result only one dealer was present
every time that the largest losses happened at the roulette table.
